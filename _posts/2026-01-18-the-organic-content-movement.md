We stand at a strange crossroads in human history. We are drowning in content. Text, images, code—it is flowing faster than we can consume it, generated by machines that never sleep and never tire.

It’s impressive. It’s useful. But it’s also... smooth. Too smooth. It lacks the friction of human thought, the charming errors of a tired brain, and the unique voice that comes from lived experience.

When you walk through a grocery store, you look for labels to trust. You look for "Non-GMO," "Fair Trade," or "USDA Organic." You want to know that what you are consuming wasn't grown in a lab, but came from the earth, tended by hands.

**Why don't we have that for the internet?**

### The Flood of Synthetic Media

Every day, the internet feels a little less "real." Comments sections are filled with bots talking to bots. Articles are churned out by LLMs optimized for SEO, not for human connection.

We are entering an era where human-created content—content that required actual blood, sweat, coffee, and frustration—is becoming a premium, artisanal product.

If I spent four hours struggling to write code or crafting an essay, I want you to know that. I want you to know that a human mind was on the other side of the screen.

### Introducing: Certified Organic Content

It’s time to differentiate the synthetic from the authentic. We need a standard. A movement. A badge that says: **This was made by a person.**

Below is a proposal for that standard. A badge for the creators, the coders, the writers, and the artists who are still doing it the hard way.

*(The badge for 100% human-grown ideas. Feel free to steal this concept.)*

#### What Does "Human Grown" Mean?

This isn't a Luddite movement. We use tools. We use spellcheck. We use IDEs.

But "Certified Organic Content" means:

1.  **The Core Idea is Human:** The thesis, the creative spark, the unique angle came from a biological brain, not a prompt.
2.  **The Effort is Real:** The majority of the execution—the actual writing of the sentences or the structuring of the code logic—was done manually.
3.  **Flaws are Features:** It might have typos. The code might not be perfectly optimized. That’s the texture of humanity. We embrace the texture.

### Join the Movement

If you are a creator who still believes in the value of human cognitive effort, adopt the label. Mention it in your footers. Put it in your bio.

Let’s create a bifurcated internet: The slick, infinite ocean of AI sludge, and the islands of certified organic, artisanal human thought.

Which one would you rather consume?
