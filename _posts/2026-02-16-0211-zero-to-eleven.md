# Show HN: 0211 – Go from zero to eleven in any topic with F1-style gear shifting

I built an AI agent mode that doesn't just teach you—it forges you into an expert through brutal, tested progression.

**TL;DR:** 0211 is a 4-gear learning system where you prove mastery at checkpoints before advancing. Each gear has RPM thresholds (75% → 80% → 85% → 90%). Fail = stay in gear. No shortcuts to expertise.

---

## The Problem

Most tutorials give you information. You forget 90% in a week. You never actually master anything.

You've been there:
- Watch a 2-hour "complete guide" to Rust
- Feel like you "get it"
- Try to build something → blank stare
- Back to YouTube for another tutorial
- Repeat until frustration

**The learning cycle that doesn't work:**

```
Consume content → Feel good → Try to apply → Fail → Consume more content
```

This is why "tutorial hell" is real. You're not learning. You're consuming.

---

## The Solution: 0211 Protocol

**Expertise is earned through gears, not given through content.**

0211 uses an F1-style gear system where you must hit RPM thresholds to shift up:

```
[1st] FOUNDATION  →  [2nd] INTERMEDIATE  →  [3rd] EXPERT  →  [4th] ELEVEN
   0-3 ⚙️              4-7 ⚙️⚙️             8-10 ⚙️⚙️⚙️         11 ⚙️⚙️⚙️⚙️
    75%                   80%                  85%                90%+
```

Each gear has:
- Specific teaching approach (patient → minimal hand-holding → Socratic)
- Checkpoint with RPM (mastery %) measurement
- **Hard requirement:** Can't shift up below threshold
- **No exceptions:** Ego doesn't get you through

## How It Works

### Activation

```
You: 0211: Machine Learning

Agent: 🎯 0211 PROTOCOL ACTIVATED
       ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
       Topic: Machine Learning
       Time: 2-4 hours (full run)
       Difficulty: BRUTAL

       🏎️ GEAR SELECT:
       [1] FOUNDATION - Zero assumed knowledge
       [2] INTERMEDIATE - Skip basics (diagnostic required)
       [3] EXPERT - Advanced start (diagnostic required)
       [R] REDLINE - Final trial immediately (5% pass rate)

You: 1
```

### Foundation Gear (Levels 0-3)

```
LEVEL 0: THE FUNDAMENTAL

Machine Learning solves one problem:
We suck at writing rules for complex patterns.

Before ML:
Want spam detection? → Write 1000 rules
Want face recognition? → Write 10000 rules
Want translation? → Impossible to write rules

With ML:
Show examples → Computer figures out rules

Think: Teaching a kid to spot dogs.
Don't give rules ("4 legs, fur, barks").
Show 100 dogs, say "dog" each time.
Kid learns the pattern.

MISCONCEPTION: "ML thinks like humans"
REALITY: ML is statistical pattern matching
WHY IT PERSISTS: We use human words ("learning", "training")

┌─────────────────────────┐
│     MACHINE LEARNING    │
│                         │
│  Examples → Model       │
│             ↓           │
│          Learns Pattern │
│             ↓           │
│          Predictions    │
└─────────────────────────┘

Quick check:
1. What's the key difference between traditional programming and ML?
2. What does the model actually "learn"?
```

### Checkpoints Don't Lie

After each gear:

```
🏁 FOUNDATION CHECKPOINT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
1. What distinguishes supervised from unsupervised learning?
2. Why can't we just "memorize" training data?
3. What's overfitting and why is it bad?
4. Explain the bias-variance tradeoff in one sentence.
5. What's the role of a validation set?

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Score: 4/5 (80%)
RPM: [████████░░] 80%

✓ Strong foundation. Minor gap on bias-variance.

Ready for 2nd Gear.

SHIFT-UP | STAY | PIT-STOP
```

**You choose what to do.** SHIFT-UP unlocks the next gear. STAY practices more. PIT-STOP saves progress.

### Redline Mode

Want to test yourself immediately?

```
You: 0211: Machine Learning | REDLINE

Agent: 🔥 REDLINE MODE
       ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
       Topic: Machine Learning
       
       Skipping to EXPERTISE PROOF.
       
       ⚠️ WARNING:
       - 95% fail this challenge
       - If you fail, I'll place you in appropriate gear
       - No warm-up, no hints, no mercy
```

The Expertise Proof has 5 parts:
1. **Knowledge** (40%) - 20 progressively harder questions
2. **Debate** (20%) - Defend a position against counterarguments
3. **Creation** (20%) - Build something original
4. **Teaching** (10%) - Explain to a 10-year-old AND an expert
5. **Prediction** (10%) - Where does this go in 2-5 years?

Pass at 90%+ = **ELEVEN ACHIEVED**

---

## Why This Works

### 1. Active Recall at Every Step

Not passive reading. You're constantly being tested. This is based on the **testing effect**—retrieval practice is more effective than re-reading.

### 2. No Ego Protection

```
⚠️ SHIFT BLOCKED

RPM: X% (need Y%+)
Gap: Z%

You're not ready. Here's why:
- [Specific gaps]

Options:
- STAY and practice [areas]
- SHIFT-DOWN to reinforce [concepts]
```

Traditional learning lets you skip ahead with "yeah, I get it." 0211 doesn't. You prove it or you stay.

### 3. Earned Progression

You can't fake your way through. The checkpoints are specific:

```
Strong: [Areas of strength]
Weak: [Areas needing work]

Next steps:
1. [Specific action]
2. [Specific review]
3. [Alternative explanation]
```

### 4. The Struggle Is the Point

**FORBIDDEN PHRASES:**
- ❌ "You're absolutely right"
- ❌ "This should work"
- ❌ "Just do X"
- ❌ "Perfect!"

**USE INSTEAD:**
- ✅ "Good. What about [edge case]?"
- ✅ "That could work. Trade-off is [X]"
- ✅ "Close. One thing to consider..."
- ✅ "Solid. Now explain why [Y]"

The struggle builds understanding. Easy feels good. Hard creates mastery.

## Real Results

I've used 0211 to go from zero to legitimate expertise in:

- **Quantum Computing** → 3.5 hours
- **Rust** → 4 hours  
- **Game Theory** → 2.5 hours

The checkpoints don't lie. You either know it or you don't.

Compare to my previous attempts:
- "Complete Rust course" (6 hours of video) → Couldn't write a function 3 days later
- 0211 Rust (4 hours with checkpoints) → Built a CLI tool the next week

## The Gear System

| Gear | Levels | RPM Required | Teaching Style |
|------|--------|--------------|----------------|
| 1st | 0-3 | 75% | Patient, analogies, kill misconceptions |
| 2nd | 4-7 | 80% | Minimal hand-holding, real problems |
| 3rd | 8-10 | 85% | Socratic, trade-offs, ambiguity |
| 4th | 11 | 90% | Expertise proof only |

**Key principle:** You control when to shift. Agent controls quality gates.

**Commands:**
- `SHIFT-UP` - Move to next gear (if at threshold)
- `STAY` - Practice more in current gear
- `SHIFT-DOWN` - Return to previous gear
- `PIT-STOP` - Save and exit
- `CHECK-RPM` - Show current mastery level
- `WHERE-AM-I` - Show progress and position

## For the HN Crowd

**Q: Is this overkill for most topics?**

Depends. Do you want to *know about* something or *master* it? 0211 is for the second category. It's overkill for "I want to understand how DNS works." It's perfect for "I need to become expert enough to architect DNS infrastructure."

**Q: What about just building things?**

That's the best way to learn. But 0211 gets you to "able to build" faster. The gears are designed so that by Level 3 (Foundation complete), you can actually start building. Levels 4+ make you *good* at building.

**Q: Can't I just use Anki or spaced repetition?**

Anki is great for memorization. 0211 is for *understanding*. The checkpoints test synthesis, not recall. The debate section makes you defend positions. The prediction section requires domain intuition.

**Q: What about topics where I'm already intermediate?**

That's what diagnostics are for. Try to start at 2nd gear, and you'll get a 5-7 question test. Pass = start there. Fail = downshift to appropriate level.

## The Code

0211 is designed for Claude Code/Opencode agent modes but works as a system prompt too.

## Discussion

**Have you tried gear-based learning systems before?** What was your experience?

**What's your take on AI tutoring vs traditional courses?** I've found AI is better at personalized struggle, but worse at curriculum design.

**Would you actually use brutal checkpoints or prefer gentler feedback?** The 75% threshold is designed to be achievable but not automatic. Too low and it doesn't enforce learning. Too high and it's discouraging.

**What topics would you run through 0211?** I'm thinking of doing distributed systems next, but open to suggestions.

**The mission:** Every interaction should deepen understanding, challenge assumptions, expose blind spots, and build *earned* confidence.

If you learned something real: **Success**
If you just copied info: **Failure**

**Make them earn eleven.** 🎯
